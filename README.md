# Sonification
Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR-Enhanced Oil Recovery) techniques are related to knowledge of oil/brine interface compositions. Thus, it is important to study the parameters that influence the interfacial properties and for this, molecular dynamics and sonification have been used. 

In this scientific initiation, the object of study is the interfaces of heptane/brine and toluene/brine, in which the formation or not of the different types of water oligomers at their interfaces and surroundings will be investigated. 

As a result, it was verified that the formation of oligomers is influenced by the interaction with the oil at the interface, being able to evaluate the extent of this effect in the aqueous phase. In addition, the main oligomers formed at both interfaces were pentamers, boats, books, bags, tetramers and chairs. 

Finally, with sonication techniques, it was possible to have a more comprehensive perception of the effect of the interface on the formation of different oligomers in the aqueous phase. This approach can be important in the dissemination of knowledge by promoting the inclusion of people with visual impairments in interface science and petroleum engineering.
